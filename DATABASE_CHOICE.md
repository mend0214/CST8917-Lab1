# Database Choice
Azure Cosmos DB Serverless is the most suitable choice for storing JSON analysis results. It stores JSON natively without requiring a predefined schema, supports serverless pricing, integrates seamlessly with Azure Functions using Python, allows SQL-like queries on JSON properties, and scales automatically without infrastructure management. Alternative options includes Azure Blob Storage which is an object storage that can store JSON files but does not provide database features and query language, Table Storage is good for non-relational data but has limited querying capabilities, and Azure SQL Database is good for relational data but less optimal for JSON data.
